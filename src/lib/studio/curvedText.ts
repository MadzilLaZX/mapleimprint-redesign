// Per-character arc layout for curved text (Section 7). Konva has no built-in curved-text node, so
// curved text is rendered as one Konva.Text per character, each placed and rotated along a circular
// arc — the standard technique for canvas-based curved type. `curve` is a unitless -100..100 knob
// (not a physical radius): magnitude controls how tight the arc is, sign controls direction
// (positive arcs upward/"smile", negative arcs downward/"frown"). 0 (or null) means straight text
// and callers should skip this entirely and render a single flat Konva.Text instead.

// QA pass root cause: curved text lays out each character as its own independent Konva.Text node
// (CanvasStage's DesignTextNode), positioned along the arc by this file — unlike a normal single
// Konva.Text string, nothing here previously measured each glyph's REAL rendered width; every
// character (bar space) was given the exact same fixed advance (fontSize*0.58), regardless of the
// font's actual glyph metrics. A narrow letter like "I" (≈3.8px at 13px Bricolage Grotesque Bold)
// was allocated the same slot as a wide one like "N" (≈10px) — visually reading as an uneven gap
// mid-word ("CELEBRATI ON") even though the layout math itself was perfectly smooth. Fixed by
// measuring each glyph with the SAME 2D canvas text-measurement API the browser already uses to
// actually draw it, using a font string that matches the real rendered font (family/weight/style)
// instead of a uniform guess. Browser-only (curved text only ever renders client-side, inside the
// dynamically-imported, ssr:false CanvasStage) — safe to use `document` directly here.
